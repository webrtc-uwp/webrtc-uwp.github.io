## Out of space VM

The VM that we used in order to run the builds quickly ran out of space, becoming almost unusable after 5 or so builds. We were hoping a script could be created, that would allow for automatic cleaning of the artifacts and files left over, and/or a way to reduce the amount of space needed for a build.
